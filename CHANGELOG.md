## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Framework Compatibility**: Updated minimum framework requirement to Glueful 1.22.0
  - Compatible with the new `ApplicationContext` dependency injection pattern
  - No code changes required in extension - framework handles context propagation
- **composer.json**: Updated `extra.glueful.requires.glueful` to `>=1.22.0`

### Notes

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **EmailChannel**: Improved configuration loading to merge core mail settings from `services.mail` with extension-specific config.
  - Core framework mail settings now take precedence for mail transport configuration.
  - Allows centralized mail configuration in the main application while extension-specific settings remain customizable.
- **EmailFormatter**: Updated logo URL resolution to use `global_variables` from config.
  - Now reads from `services.mail.templates.global_variables.logo_url` for consistency with core framework.
  - Falls back to extension default if not configured.

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing configurations continue to work.
- For centralized mail configuration, define settings in `config/services.php` under the `mail` key.

### Breaking Changes
- **PHP 8.3 Required**: Minimum PHP version raised from 8.2 to 8.3.

### Changed

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added

- New config file at `config/email-notification.php` merged via `register()`.
- Symfony Mailer transports with failover and provider bridges.

### Changed
- Composer metadata updated to reflect Symfony Mailer and modern discovery.

### Migration Notes
- Ensure your app uses the modern extensions system and runs `php glueful extensions:cache` after install.
- If overriding templates, update paths per README guidance.
- Install provider bridge packages as needed (e.g., `symfony/brevo-mailer`, `symfony/sendgrid-mailer`).
